**Project Rengage**

**Project Goal:** Recreate the Organizations section of the University of Oklahoma’s Engage page to allow students to learn more information about the clubs they are interested in and give them more personalized recommendations for potential clubs to join.

**Project Overview:** Rengage is a web-based application designed to help university students find and join clubs that align with their interests. By selecting preferences such as likes, major, and interests, students receive personalized club recommendations from a university club database.

**We are designing Rengage to:**

* Make the website more user friendly.  
* Increase student involvement around campus.  
* Help students find a community that aligns with their interests.

**Features:** 

* User Input: Students can input their preferences from a drop down selection list that includes likes, major, and interests.  
* Club Recommendation: Based on the user’s input, the website recommends university clubs that match the student’s selections.  
* University Database Integration: The system pulls club data from a university database to provide accurate information regarding the available clubs at the University of Oklahoma.

**Current Tasks:**

* Trying to get OU’s database information for clubs and organizations from the Director of Student Government and Organization Services.   
* We will be reciveing:   
  * Organization name  
  * Number of members in the roster  
  * Organization description 

**Branch Plan:**

* Any group member who plans to make changes will create their own branch.  
* Upon completion of the change the member will add their commit to their branch and inform the group leader.  
* The group leader then will review the code and is responsible for ensuring that it works with the rest of the project.  
* The group leader will then merge the branch with the master and delete the member’s branch

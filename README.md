**Project Rengage**

**Project Goal:** Recreate the Organizations section of the University of Oklahoma’s Engage page to allow students to learn more information about the clubs they are interested in and give them more personalized recommendations for potential clubs to join.

**Project Overview:** Rengage is a web-based application designed to help university students find and join clubs that align with their interests. By selecting preferences such as likes, major, and interests, students receive personalized club recommendations from a university club database.

**We are designing Rengage to:**

* Make the website more user friendly.  
* Increase student involvement around campus.  
* Help students find a community that aligns with their interests.
* Allow officers and advisors easy access to important documents and rosters for both academic and social purposes.

**Features:** 

* User Input: Students can input their preferences from a drop down selection list that includes likes, major, and interests.  
* Club Recommendation: Based on the user’s input, the website recommends university clubs that match the student’s selections.  
* University Database Integration: The system pulls club data from a university database to provide accurate information regarding the available clubs at the University of Oklahoma.
* Quality of life: Sinced we aim to cater towards not just incoming freshmen, but to club members and chairs as well, we seek to create an easy way for our users to access mandatory documents and stay up-to-date with club agendas and duties.

**Current Tasks:**

* Trying to get OU’s database information for clubs and organizations from the Director of Student Government and Organization Services.   
* At the minimum we will be recieving:   
  * Organization name  
  * Number of members in the roster  
  * Organization description
  * 9/19/2024 Still waiting on a response from the Director of Student Givernment and Organization Services
* Learning HTML at the moment to create and design the homepage of the site, and any branch sites that may stem from links and such.

**Branch Plan:**

* Any group member who plans to make changes will create their own branch.  
* Upon completion of the change the member will add their commit to their branch, push the changes, and inform the group leader.  
* The group leader then will review the code and is responsible for ensuring that it works with the rest of the project.  
* If the code works with the rest of the program the group leader will then merge the branch with the master and delete the member’s branch.

**Git Commands:**

* Pull up to date project: ```git pull```
* Show modified files in working directory ```git status```
* Create and switch to a branch: ```git checkout -b "branch_name"```
* Stage changes: ```git add filename``` or ```git add --all```
* Commit changes: ```git commit -m "message"```
* Push changes: ```git push```
* Merge branches: ```git merge branch_name```
* Switch branches: ```git switch branch_name```
* Abort a merge in case of conflicts: ```git merge --abort```
